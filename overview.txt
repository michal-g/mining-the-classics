This is an overview of the steps taken to process and mine the "recovering the classics epubs 50" made available as part of the CODEX Hackathon 2016.

1. Classic novel .epub files were downloaded from the CODEX Hackathon website, and converted to .txt files using the Zamzar online conversion tool.

2. Novel text was edited to remove prefaces, author's notes, introductions, tables of contents, chapter headings, and anything else that did not consitute the main body of the novel.
